Machine Learning (Foundation) Study Group for Hardware Engineer.  
  
This repository is for recording of “Machine Learning (Foundation) Study Group for Hardware Engineer”.  

**Background**  
These days, data what we are dealing with become more complex and the amount of that became larger.  
So I believe that analytical skill for data are becoming important not only for Software Engineer but also Hardware Engineer.  

**Object**  
In this Study Group, we plan to learn “Foundation of Machine Learning” and “How to implement of it using Python.”  

**Text book**  
“Python Machine Learning” by Sebastian Raschka.  

**Recommended IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
