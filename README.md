# Machine Learning Study Group 2018 (MLSG18)
Machine Learning Study Group for Hardware Engineer.  
  
This repository is for record about “Machine Learning Study Group for Hardware Engineer”.  

### Background   
These days, data what we are dealing with become more complex and the size of that become larger.  
I believe that data analytical skills are becoming very important, not only for Software Engineer but also Hardware Engineer.  

### Object  
In this Study Group, we plan to learn “Foundation of Machine Learning” and “How to implement of it using Python.”  

### Text book  
“Python Machine Learning” by Sebastian Raschka.  

### Recommended IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  
Jupyter Notebook
