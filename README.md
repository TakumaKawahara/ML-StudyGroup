# Machine Learning Study Group 2018 (MLSG18)
Machine Learning Study Group for Hardware Engineer.  
  
This repository is for record of “Machine Learning (Foundation) Study Group for Hardware Engineer”.  

### Background   
These days, data what we are dealing with become more complex and the size of that become larger.  
So I believe that data analytical skill are becoming very important, not only for Software Engineer but also Hardware Engineer.  

### Object  
In this Study Group, we plan to learn “Foundation of Machine Learning” and “How to implement of it using Python.”  

### Text book  
“Python Machine Learning” by Sebastian Raschka.  

### Recommended IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  
Jupyter Notebook  
  
### Schedule  
>**12.Apr.2018(Thu.)**  
Introduction of Maltivariable regression.  
How to use Python.  
  
>**19.Apr.2018(Thu.)**  
EDA Exploratory Data Analysis  
OLS Ordinary Least Squares  
  
>**26.Apr.2018(Thu.)**  
Evaluation of model 1 (MSE, RMSE, R-squared)  
Multivariable regression   
  
  
>**TBD**  
- Data Preprocessing (Data type, Missing value, One-hot encoding, feature scaling)  
- Logistic regression 
- Evaluation of model 2 (Pipe line, Cross validation, LOOCV, Hold-out, Learning curve and Validation curve, Grid search)    
- Sparse modeling (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net)  
- Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Evaluation of model 3 (Confusion matrix, ROC curve)  
- PCA Principal Component Analysis  
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis  
- k-means algorithm  
- Hierarchical clustering  
- DBSCAN Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
- SVM Support Vector Machine, kernel SVM
